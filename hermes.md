## About
Hermes is a system with unparalleled simplicity that allows for you to connect your Minecraft server to Discord. To our knowledge,
it's the *only* system that does not require you to set up your own Discord bot or pull channel IDs manually. Aphelia does it all for you. To that end, there are
still three small steps you must take to install Hermes:

## Instructions
* Install Hermes Universal as a plugin on your server. You can currently get it by asking for a beta from the team through [our discord](/discord/),
as it is currently only in beta, however, we'll be making a public download within a week.
* Run /token in your server. Copy and paste the command to a Discord channel which Aphelia is in. 
* Run the command you just pasted. You're done! Everything is now linked from Minecraft to Discord!
