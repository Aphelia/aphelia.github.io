## About
Hermes is a system with unparalleled simplicity that allows for you to connect your Minecraft server to Discord. To our knowledge,
it's the *only* system that does not require you to set up your own Discord bot or pull channel IDs manually. Aphelia does it all for you. To that end, there are
still three small steps you must take to install Hermes:

## Instructions
* If you haven't already, [invite Aphelia](/invite/).
* Install Hermes Universal as a plugin on your server. It's available on [our discord](/discord/). We'll soon be uploading it to download from other sites (like SpigotMC), however, we don't want to do that just yet as there are still many more features to come.
* Run /token in your server. Copy and paste the command to a Discord channel which Aphelia is in. If you've changed Aphelia's prefix, you need to adjust the command accordingly.
* Send the command you just copied into the channel that you wish to act as the bridge. You're done! Everything is now linked from Minecraft to Discord!
