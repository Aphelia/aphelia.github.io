# Help with Tickets
## Creating a base ticket channel
You were probably directed here after seeing a message saying that you should probably create a base ticket. A base ticket is a channel that new tickets will be based off of (permissions and the like are copied). This is a way to further customize the channel, in line with our "simplicity with customizability" motto. To get started, simply create a channel called ``base-ticket``, and set the desired permissions. It will automatically be detected and used for new tickets. There you go! Note that you can only create 1 base ticket channel, otherwise, it will not be recognized.
Note: Base-tickets copy everything *except* messages.
