As much as we hope that the commands are self explanatory enough, sometimes, the name and the help menu is just not enough.

## Commands
* ``checkComs`` This command checks to see if Aphelia is working. If you do not get a reply, either Aphelia doesn't have permissions, or it is offline.
* ``newShortcut`` Shortcuts are a way to create a "trigger" that Aphelia will autorespond to. For example, if you did ``newShortcut aphelia Hello,_I'm_Aphelia``, whenever Aphelia sees a message that says "Aphelia", Aphelia will respond with "Hello, I'm Aphelia!"
* ``delShortcut`` Deletes a shortcut. The opposite of ``newShortcut``.
* ``help`` Get the list of commands.
* ``connectMC`` This command requires you to install the [ComLink plugin](/comlink/comlink-spigot.jar) on your Minecraft server. It will give you instructions on how to set it up once you download it and add it as a plugin on your Spigot server.
* ``balance`` Checks your balance. I think I don't have to explain this further.
* ``giveCoins`` Gives you coins... This one should be quite obvious
* ``takeCoins`` I really don't have to explain this one.
* ``ticket`` Creates a new ticket. You may need to further set this up for full functionality; there is [a guide here](/tickethelp)
* ``close`` Closes a ticket. Opposite of ``ticket``.
* ``gamble`` Gambles your coins. Takes one argumentâ€”how much to gamble.
* ``changePrefix`` Changes the command prefix. Does not affect shortcuts.
* ``inform`` Creates an announcement in a style that only bots can use. Try it and see!

*Is there a command you want to have, but can't find? Make a feature request!*
