## Inviting Aphelia
* To use Aphelia, you must first [invite it to your Discord](https://aphelia.github.io/invite).
* Type ``!help`` in your Discord to list the commands
* Some features need to be further set up. However, most features work right out of the box. For example, you may need to create a base-ticket channel to get the most out of the ticket system. You also need to add a plugin to your Minecraft server if you wish to use the chat bridge.
