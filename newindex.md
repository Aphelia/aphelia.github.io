# About
Aphelia is a Discord bot that allows you to create tickets, custom commands, economies, and more. Aphelia strives 
to be very simple to use (as seen in the name "Aphelia", the Greek goddess of simplicity), while still being feature-rich.
Aphelia is under heavy development, meaning that new features are released to stable almost every week (yes, plural), and
features are released to Beta almost every other day. We do take feature requests very seriously, and work on them a lot.
In fact, two of our most recent features (tickets and a Minecraft bridge) were requested by a user!
